\section{How to run the project}\label{sec:how_to_run_project}
First, you can clone the project repo from github in the following way
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small, breaklines]{bash}
git clone https://github.com/nikodallanoce/ComputationalMathematics/
\end{minted}
Then you can work with each method separately on Matlab by going inside the chosen algorithm folder and running \textit{run\_method.m}, change the hyper-parameters as you prefer.
