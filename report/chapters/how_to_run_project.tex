\section{How to run the project}\label{sec:how_to_run_project}
First, you can clone the project repo from github in the following way
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\small, breaklines]{bash}
git clone https://github.com/nikodallanoce/ComputationalMathematics/
\end{minted}
Then, you can work with each method separately on Matlab by going inside the chosen algorithm folder and running \textit{run\_method.m}, changing the parameters as you prefer.

\noindent Iterative methods such as L-BFGS \ref{subsec:lbfgs}, CG \ref{sec:conjugate_gradient} and SMD \ref{sec:smd}, return the solution, the iterations needed to converge and, optionally, the history of the points computed at each step ($x_k$). All these methods can take in input a "callback" function that is called at the and of each iteration and takes in input the computed point $x_k$ and the iteration $k$. For instance, we defined a callback function that computes the relative error and residual.
