## Wilcard Project
Solving the linear least squares problem with the following algorithms:
- (A1) is an algorithm of the class of **limited-memory quasi-Newton methods**.
- (A2) is **thin QR factorization with Householder reflectors**, in the variant where one does not form the matrix Q, but stores the Householder vectors u_k and uses them to perform (implicitly) products with Q and Q^T.
- (A3) is an algorithm of the class of **Conjugate Gradient methods**.
- (A4) is a **standard momentum descent (heavy ball)** approach.
